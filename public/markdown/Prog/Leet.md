# Leetcode 75 Notes

## Algorithm Notes

### Euclidean Algorithm for Greatest Common Denominator

#### [1768. Merge Strings Alternately](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-strings-alternately/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=leetcode-75)

- This was quite helpful in learning the algorithm: [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/cryptography/modarithmetic/a/the-euclidean-algorithm#:~:text=The%20Algorithm,%3D%20B%E2%8B%85Q%20%2B%20R)

### Check if Sorting Can Speed Up the Algorithm

### Reuse Similar Calculations

- For example, using a sliding window.
- Good sliding window question: [643. Maximum Average Sub-array I](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-average-subarray-i/)

### Understand the Question Requirements

- Question descriptions can be misleading.
- Example: [1657. Determine if Two Strings Are Close](https://leetcode.com/problems/determine-if-two-strings-are-close/)

### Prefix Sum

- The prefix sum (cumulative sum/inclusive scan) of a sequence of numbers is the sums of the prefixes (running totals) of the input sequence.

| **Input Nums**  | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   | 6   |
| --------------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Prefix Sums** | 1   | 3   | 6   | 10  | 15  | 21  |

### Stack

- Notice if the problem description fits a LIFO or FIFO approach. If so, use a stack to speed things up.
- Example: [This is a good example](https://leetcode.com/problems/removing-stars-from-a-string/)

### Linked List

- If the question involves the $i^{th}$ element, try the fast pointer slow pointer approach.

# Problems to Try Again

- [443. String Compression](https://leetcode.com/problems/string-compression/)
- [1679. Max Number of K-Sum Pairs](https://leetcode.com/problems/max-number-of-k-sum-pairs/)
- [1004. Max Consecutive Ones III](https://leetcode.com/problems/max-consecutive-ones-iii/)
- [1657. Determine if Two Strings Are Close](https://leetcode.com/problems/determine-if-two-strings-are-close/)

### Stack Problems Are Confusing

- [735. Asteroid Collision](https://leetcode.com/problems/asteroid-collision/)
- [394. Decode String](https://leetcode.com/problems/decode-string/)

### Linked List

- [328. Odd Even Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/odd-even-linked-list/)
