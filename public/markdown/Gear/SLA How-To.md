# SLA How-To

Note this is a really simple set of instructions intended originally for my parents :).

## Finding Something To Make

1. Go to Thangs in Google. (Or design your own.)
2. You can just scroll down to look for models or you can use the search bar.
3. Once you find something, find the download link and download it.

## Get The File Ready To Be Printed

1. Insert USB into the computer.
2. Open ChitUBox.
3. In the top left, click the open file button and select the file you downloaded.
4. You can now use any tools in this program to resize the model, for example.
5. At the top, click the hollow button.
6. At the top, click the auto layout button then click center.
7. On the top right of the screen, click on the supports button.
8. At the bottom of the tab that opened, click on the +Platform button.
9. Now click the other button at the top right of the screen to go back to the first view.
10. Click Slice.
11. Here you can see important info on the right like time for print, cost, weight, millimeters needed, etc.
12. Click save.
13. You can now name it and below the naming entry make sure you have .cbt file type selected.
14. Now locate the USB on your computer and save the file there.
15. Wait a few seconds then remove the USB.

## Start The Print

1. Make sure you have enough resin in the vat.
2. Check that the build plate is on and screwed down.
3. Click the power button on the front.
4. Insert the USB into the left side of the printer.
5. On the screen, click print, then find the model you want to print and select it.
6. Hit the start button.
7. Put the cover back on the printer.
8. Make sure active ventilation is going.

## Post Processing

1. Put on gloves.
2. Remove the lid and unscrew the build plate screw a bit.
3. Remove the build plate and place it with the print in the alcohol bath.
4. Leave it for around 5-10 minutes.
5. Pull it out of the bath and try to drip dry it until it's reasonably dry.
6. Now cut any supports that attach the model to the build plate with the side cutters until the model is removed.
7. Put the model in the curing station and click the left button on top of the machine to start it.
8. Clean up the build plate by removing any plastic still on it. You can dip it in the bath again and use a paper towel to clean it.
9. Put the build plate back on the printer and tighten the screw until it's firm.
10. Once the buzzer goes off, you can grab the model and make sure no parts of it look shiny. If they are, put it back in the curing station. If not, then you can safely touch it with your hands. Any wetness is just the alcohol. You can use a blow dryer to dry that off.
11. Now remove any supports off the model.
