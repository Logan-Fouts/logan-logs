# Creality LD-002H
Let me preface this by saying I really prefer standard FDM printing. I like that the parts are more robust and are often ready to be used as soon as they are off the build plate. However, this is just some of the things I have learned while using this printer. Hopefully putting this info here can help me in the future when I inevitably get frustrated with the printer again.

## Main  Issues Faced
### Dimensions too small
This is by far the most annoying aspect for me and I have not totally figured it out, but I do still have some tips.
**Scaling**
- I have found that scaling around an entire 7% gets the parts to be just about the correct size in the real world. Of course this is assuming you modeled the part to the exact dimensions.
### Prints not sticking to the bed
**Bed leveling**
- The main fix I found for this issue was simply leveling the bed.
- I did this by loosening the screws around the build plate then lowering the plate to home with a piece of paper folded over once. Then once it was all flattened out tightened up the screws and made sure there was just a bit of friction between the paper and the plate.
**Slicer settings**
- Some of the times I would have issues with adhesion even after leveling. The fix I would do here is increase the number of bottom layers and also increase the bottom exposure time. 
 The only reason  I don't like to do this is that it seems to increase the elephants foot issue.
### Bed struggling to lift off of screen
This was a strange issue I faced where it seemed the bed was unable to unstick itself from the screen. I found that the issue was that the screw the bed moves up and down on had come loose from the motor. So, I just tightened the bolts where the screw was connected to the motor. This immediately helped my prints look soo much better.
### Flat prints not square
**Object orientation**
- When I would want a nice flat print often the print would come out a bit wonky for a lack of a better term.
- This was fixed for the most part by printing parallel to the bed with the flat surface, as well as printing directly on the bed
### Prints look bad after curing
This issue for me comes down to two issues: 
1. Poor resin cleaning
- As you could imagine the fix is to just be more thorough with the washing of the parts.
2. Not letting the part dry entirely before putting it in the curing station

### General Tips
### Detailed print recommendations
This may be kinda basic but it took me awhile to figure it out. But, when printing more detailed items it seems best to print with some lift off the bed with supports as well as at about a 30 degree angle.
### Room temp
Unfortunately the people saying the temp of the room having an effect of print quality are correct. So, I would recommend heating the room up decently warm before trying to print. This seems to help with many of the liquid physics issues that can come with resin printing like suction and whatnot.
### Post processing
I would highly recommend sanding parts after printing and just spray painting them.  After that quick process the parts almost look like they are injection.
