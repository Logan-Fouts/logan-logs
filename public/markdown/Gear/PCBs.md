# Keyboard PCB Design Documentation

## Intro

Designing a keyboard PCB (Printed Circuit Board) requires attention to detail and an understanding of electronic design principles. This documentation provides guidance on effective practices, including routing, layer management, vias, symbol and footprint alignment, and documentation for manufacturing.

## Matching Up Symbols and Footprints

- **Verification:** Double-check the dimensions and pin assignments of both symbols and footprints against the component datasheets.
- **Consistency:** Use a standardized naming convention for easy identification and matching.
- **Library Management:** Maintain a library of verified symbols and footprints for efficient reuse in future projects.

## How to Use Multiple Layers

- **Signal Layers:** Typically, the top layer is reserved for critical signals, and the bottom layer for less critical paths.
- **Ground and Power Planes:** Inner layers are often used as ground or power planes to provide a stable voltage reference and reduce electromagnetic interference (EMI).
- **Layer Management:** Balance the distribution of components and routes across layers to avoid overcrowding and ensure manufacturability.

## Proper Routing Practices

- **Keep routes short and direct:** This minimizes resistance and potential signal loss.
- **Use 45-degree angles:** Sharp angles can cause signal reflection and impedance issues.
- **Separate analog and digital signals:** This prevents digital noise from affecting analog components.
- **Route power traces first:** Prioritize power connections to ensure stable voltage supply across all components.

## Vias

- **Through-Hole Vias:** These vias connect layers from top to bottom and are used in most PCB designs.
- **Blind Vias:** Connect the outer layer to one or more inner layers but do not go through the entire board.
- **Buried Vias:** Connect only the inner layers and are not visible from the outer layers.

## Creating BOM and POS Files

- **BOM File:** Lists all the components used in the PCB, including part numbers, descriptions, quantities, and specifications.
- **POS File:** Contains the position, orientation, and reference designators of each component on the PCB, crucial for automated assembly processes.
- **Software Tools:** Utilize PCB design software to automatically generate these files, ensuring accuracy and completeness.

## Conclusion

Adhering to proper design practices and effectively utilizing design tools are key to creating a high-quality keyboard PCB. By following the guidelines outlined in this documentation, designers can ensure their projects meet performance standards and are ready for manufacturing.
